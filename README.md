# DINGDONG

I don't always hear the doorbell but Alexis does.
So I did the reasonable thing: 
 
created a jets / lambda webserver that calls me, which is triggered by a very large button hooked up to a raspberry pi, which Alexis then pushes when the actual doorbell rings.

mostly I'm just procratinating. I really need to study.

## Webserver 
 
```
jets new doorbell --mode api --no-database
jets generate controller Dingdong create
```
patch the routes file 
 
create an iam user with irresponsible permissions 
```

## Configure the PI
edit `/etc/xdg/openbox/lxde-pi-rc.xml` - you're not supposed to but whatever we've already wandered far from 'best practices' 

add this to the `<keyboard>` section
```
<!-- <keyboard> -->
  <keybind key="C-S-9">
    <action name="Execute"/>
  <command>bash -c "curl -SivkL --header "authorization: $auth_header" $api-endpoint/dev/dingdong</command>
    </action>
  </keybind>
<!-- </keyboard> -->
```
 
`openbox --restart && openbox-lxde-pi --restart` 
 
PUSH ZEE BUTTON
